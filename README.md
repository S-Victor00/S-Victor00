# Encrypted Voices

This project is an activist website/organization and the problem I am addressing is internet safety/data privacy online due to the increasing numbers of cyber attacks and breaches.

##  Description

This project has three main places the user can explore to learn more about the sensitivity of data privacy, which are the home/first page, learn more page, then a facts page. But there's another page that will be linked, it is in the footer and it's another project that directly connects to stressing this cause.

   <h2> Why Encrypted Voices? </h2>
    <p> Digital privacy isn’t optional — it’s essential.
    Every click, message, and download can leave a trace. <br> Without strong global protections, personal data is vulnerable to theft, surveillance, and manipulation. <br> Encrypted Voices was created to educate, empower, and push for stronger international laws.</p>
    <h2> What We Stand For</h2>
    <p> ● Advocating global digital privacy rights
    <br> <br> ● Exposing real-life stories from students and youth
    <br><br> ● Teaching people how to protect themselves online
    <br><br> ●  Uniting voices to demand policy change</p>

    <h2>Naive. Desperate. Targeted.</h2>
    <p>I was just trying to find work. An email came through our school account offering a student assistant job. It looked legit—same school logo, same tone. I clicked. I filled out the form. Then the messages started coming in.

      <br><br> Later, we all got an announcement: our school's system had been breached. It wasn’t just me. So many of us had been tricked. That moment changed how I saw the internet—it's not just websites and fun, it's risk and responsibility.

      <br><br>I created <i> Encrypted Voices</i> so others won’t fall like we did.</p>
